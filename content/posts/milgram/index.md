# Project

Obedience the project was born when I moved back to the states after the first wave of Covid, and signed up for Instacart. 

I'd been living in Portugal, where the "gig economy" is thankfully less ubiquitous. I'd been following Covid since December 2019, and I was pretty concerned about it. In March, before it came to Madeira, I had bought a fair amount of extra toilet paper and canned foods, because I had zero clue how the island's supply chains would stand up. In late March when I shopped for my family I was fully masked and gloved, and folks thought I was nuts. And as I was reading a lot of US media, I was
reading about the number of folks who could afford it getting gig workers to go out for them. It seemed really problematic to me. I didn't see remorse. I saw people saying "thank heavens I can have people shop for me," as if their thankful situation was not related to the situation of those less fortunate. Having worked in the space of drones and teleoperation, here was a clear case of a technology mediating -- and making it easier to inflict -- potential damage and pain.

Of course, landing in Newark and driving straight to Ithaca, we had to quarantine for two weeks. Shopping would have been an irresponsible violation of quarantine, so we had our first batch of groceries delivered. Hence Instacart. So easy! I felt a bit bad but that was tempered by the fact that we were obeying New York's guidance. But here I was, remote controlling a shopper through a smartphone. My mind immediately turned to the Milgram experiments, which it seems to me are the perfect
metaphor for the gig economy, especially during Covid.

Here then, will be a thread about my Obedience (working title) project, to remix the Milgram experiments with the gig economy for fun, pain, and profit.
