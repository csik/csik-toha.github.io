Mobile money is a peer-to-peer electronic money transfer innovation lauded for enabling access to financial services to low income groups in the developing world, who are often excluded by traditional banks and financial organizations. First successfully launched in 2007 in Kenya, under the M-Pesa brand, mobile money has been lauded by the development community “for its potential to improve economic and human development” [1]. Yet mobile money’s ascendance should not be viewed in isolation. It closely follows in the paths of microfinance; an industry championed by Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh in the 80s.

The microfinance model principally addressed crucial problems associated with the high cost of credit and poor credit cultures that had pillaged financial sectors in developing world in the intervening years after the 50s. Accordingly, low income groups of people were able to access small uncollateralized loans because the model enforced the use social pressure and social shaming, informal methods central to credit contract enforcement.

Towards 2010, there was a marked change in the policy agenda for financial sector development that turned its attention from microfinance to “finance for all” and more “financial systems” beyond the original microfinance movement that prioritized microlending to disparate groups of low income earners and individuals in the developing world. In so doing, microfinance [silently] transitioned from nimble donor-led arrangements to more “professionalized” and “commercialized” logics aimed at profitability and long-term growth.

The transition from microfinance to “financialization” came with the need for a diverse range of financial services including savings, deposits, and insurance. Indeed, access to financial services is linked to improvement of livelihoods and poverty reduction and wider economic development. As noted by Ghosh [2] with a nod to Taylor, the concept of financial inclusion – or “finance for all” as shown above – is the “hallmark of the drive to commercialize microfinance”. Indeed, Taylor observes that financial inclusion is a powerful legitimizing narrative that combines the moral imperative to extend access to financial services to the poor and unbanked, and the development imperative that seeks to mitigate the vulnerabilities of poor households and individuals. Mader [3], in a searing takedown argues that the “moral crusaders” – i.e., banks, financial technology companies, and large philanthropies – in the new world of “poverty finance” view poverty as an ill that must be engaged through financial services extension. To this effect, the crusaders fervently proclaim that the benefits of “dethroning cash as king” could have innumerable benefits to the vulnerable poor and could even enable more women participate in the economy and have better odds at economic prosperity. Although there is growing evidence on the potential benefits of financial inclusion now well marketed under mobile money, the profit-oriented logics that drives the financial inclusion narrative raise critical questions about the implications of digitalizing poor people’s money and begs important questions on development actors’ (in)action on structural and political problems.
