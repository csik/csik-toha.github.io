Technology is a force multiplier. Many historical accounts of human progress show dramatic increments in productivity and improvement in livelihoods in places of technology’s wake. However, the making of technology, its adoption, and the subsequent access to it is not without debatable design considerations and historical legacies that beg for deeper analyses to tease out both departures and continuities over time (Mann & Iazzolino, 2021). 

Digital technology has captured popular imagination in the development and donor world because of its promises to democratize access to information and bridge institutional and market inefficiencies (Aker & Mbiti, 2010; Mann & Iazzolino, 2021). In particular, the emergence of mobile telephony in the developing world at the turn of the 2000s marked new policy paradigms in international development and renewed the fight against poverty. In a 2008 article, the New York Times boldly asked: “Can the Cellphone Help End Poverty?”(Corbett, 2008).

They were certainly not alone in the enthusiasm and imagination. According to Donner (2015), Jeffrey Sachs, a renowned international economist, declared that the mobile phone “is the single most transformative technology for development”. Amartya Sen, too, in a 2010 essay entitled “The Mobile and the World,” declared that the mobile phone was the greatest development tool ever invented (Kusimba, 2021). Closely related, the World Bank in their seminal 2012 Information and Communications for Development report asserted that the mobile phone has had a bigger impact on humankind in a shorter period of time than any other invention (Donner, 2015).

Enter mobile money, a recent peer-to-peer electronic money transfer innovation popular in the developing world for providing alternative means for affordable and useful access to financial services to low income groups, often excluded by traditional banks and financial organizations (Hughes & Lonie, 2007). First successfully launched in 2007 in Kenya by Safaricom, under the M-Pesa brand, mobile money has been lauded by the development community “for its potential to improve economic and human development” (Donovan, 2015).

However, mobile money’s ascendance closely follows in the stead of the rise and fall of microfinance. The microfinance sector had previously gained momentum in the 1990s following wide scale efforts towards deregulation and globalization of financial markets, although initial experiments began in the 70s and 80s in Bangladesh and the Dominican Republic aimed at providing loans to low income groups for entrepreneurship (Ghosh, 2018; Mader, 2016). In fact, the “Grameen model” championed in Bangladeshi by Muhammad Yunus became the blueprint for the burgeoning industry (Hulme, 2008). Accordingly, the model targeted rural women who were less likely to default because it addressed crucial problems associated with the high cost of credit and poor credit cultures that had pillaged financial sectors in developing world in the intervening years after the 50s. To this effect, joint liability microfinance accounts and the use of social pressure and social shaming not only diminished cost of credit but also enhanced credit contract enforcement. Moreover, Muhammad Yunus had declared that access to credit/loans was a “human right” and that every capable human being could lift themselves by their bootstraps through micro-entrepreneurship (Hulme, 2008; Mader, 2016).

Meanwhile, microfinance (silently) transitioned from nimble donor-led arrangements to more “professionalized” and “commercialized” logics aimed at profitability and long term growth (Ghosh, 2018). Moreover, towards 2010, there was a marked change in the policy agenda for financial sector development that turned its attention from microfinance to ensuring access to “finance for all” and more “financial systems” beyond the original microcredit remit that administered credit to disparate groups of low income earners and individuals (Johnson & Nino-Zarazua, 2009; Ghosh, 2018).

The transition from microfinance to “financialization” came with the need for a diverse range of financial services including savings, deposits, and insurance. Indeed, access to financial services is linked to improvement of livelihoods and poverty reduction and wider economic development (Demirgüç-Kunt, Klapper, & Van Oudheusden, 2015; Duvendack & Mader, 2019). As noted by Ghosh (2018) in reference to Taylor’s (2006) suggestion that the concept of financial inclusion–or “finance for all” as shown above– is the “hallmark of the drive to commercialize microfinance”. Additionally, Taylor observes that financial inclusion is a powerful legitimizing narrative that combines the moral imperative to extend access to financial services to the poor and unbanked, and the development imperative that seeks to mitigate the vulnerabilities of poor households and individuals. Mader (2016), in a searing takedown argues that “moral crusaders” operating in the new world of “poverty finance” view poverty as an ill that must be engaged through financial services extension. To this effect, the crusaders fervently proclaim that the benefits of “dethroning cash as king” could have innumerable benefits to the vulnerable poor and could even enable more women participate in the economy and have better odds at economic prosperity (Mader, 2016). Although there is growing evidence attesting to the innumerable potential and benefits of financial inclusion and its contemporary, digital financial inclusion, the profit-oriented logics that drives the digital financial inclusion narrative raises critical questions about the implications of digitalising poor people’s money and begs important questions on development actors’ (in)action on structural and political problems (Mader, 2016).
