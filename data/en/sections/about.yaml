# a summary about you
summary: 'Most technology serves entrenched power. The Redistributive Computing Systems (RCS) group seeks to understand and explore alternative systems and processes for technical innovation which do not recreate the status quo. This includes new methods for developing computational systems that support resistance by subaltern groups; methods of technical inclusion in cooperative deliberative design; publicly reverse-engineering regressive technologies; and creating technologies of empathy. Through tactical and opportunist interventions leveraging both experimental and theoretical techniques, we seek to abstract novel strategic configurations of power through technology. While this approach may be seen as politicizing technology, our work is based on the knowledge that *all* technologies are political and *most* are hegemonic; RCS systems offer a necessary corrective insubordination.'
