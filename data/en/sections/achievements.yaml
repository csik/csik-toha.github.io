  summary: I am currently a Ph.D. student in Information Science at Cornell University; I like long walks and anti-facist country music. My past work in data science has been applied to building energy efficiency, to Indigenous land management, to fair political mapping practices. Presently, my research interests have shifted focus towards cultivating computational systems and citizen science tools that incorporate and support Indigenous, primarily Haudenosaunee, epistemes and methodologies.
